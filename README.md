# Real_World_Projects
 high-performance models with hands-on real-world examples

# What is this about?
This project covers the following exciting features:

* Recognize the importance of interpretability in business
* Study models that are intrinsically interpretable such as linear models, decision trees, and Na√Øve Bayes
* Become well-versed in interpreting models with model-agnostic methods
* Visualize how an image classifier works and what it learns
* Understand how to mitigate the influence of bias in datasets

# Instructions and Navigations
#### Software and Hardware List
software required in any operating system by first installing Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab with the most recent version of Python, or install Anaconda which can install everything at once. While hardware requirements for Jupyter are relatively modest, we recommend a machine with at least 4 cores of 2Ghz and 8Gb of RAM.
Alternatively, to installing the software locally, you can run the code in the cloud using Google Colab or another cloud notebook service.
